Description: `asp22lasso` is an R package which extends the existing [`lmls` package](https://github.com/hriebl/lmls)
    with LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression. 
    `lmls` is a multi-predictor regression with explanatory variables for the 
    mean (= the location) and the standard deviation (= the scale) of a normally 
    distributed response variable.
    LASSO regression adds a penalty to these coefficients and shrinks them
    towards or to zero. The optimal hyperparameter lambda, which controls the strength
    of the LASSO penalty, is found via Cross-Validation.
